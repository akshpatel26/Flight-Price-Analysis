# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, we performed EDA to understand the distribution of data and relationships between features. Some of the visualizations include:


• Distribution of airlines and their average pricing.


• Class distribution in airlines.


• Analysis of business and economy class flights.


• Day-Wise Distribution of Flights.


• Price trends based on departure time and arrival time.
